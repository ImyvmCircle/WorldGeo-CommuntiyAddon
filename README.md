## Introduction

This Project is designed to constitute a comprehensive framework for player community in Minecraft servers. It is built on
the IMYVMWorldGeo as an extension, which provides mechanics centered around **Region**, performing a Minecraft geography element.
We intend to offer an administration simulation system granting players the ability to self-govern their in-game regions
in the form of a player community.




## Acknowledgements

Were it not for the support of IMYVM fellows and players, this project would not have been possible.
