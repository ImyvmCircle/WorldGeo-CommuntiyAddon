in the form of a player community.

the community is created with a pending status, awaiting certification.
Once being certified, the community is a sovereign entity that can direct its internal affairs,
with also foreign relations to be established with other communities online.

#### Types

There exist two types of communities, the first of which is the manor. A manor is defined by
